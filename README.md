TASK 1
# File Reader Program in Python

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This Python program demonstrates **file handling** in Python.  
It tries to open and read a file named `sample.txt`, printing its contents line by line.  
If the file does not exist, it handles the error gracefully using **exception handling**.


TASK 2
# File Write, Append, and Read Program in Python

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This Python program demonstrates how to:
1. **Write user input** to a file (`output.txt`)  
2. **Append more text** to the same file  
3. **Read and display** the final contents of the file  

It showcases Pythonâ€™s file handling modes:
- `"w"` â†’ Write (overwrites the file if it exists)  
- `"a"` â†’ Append (adds new data at the end of the file)  
- `"r"` â†’ Read (reads file content)
